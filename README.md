# Health Metric Dash

Health Metric Dash provides a dashboard of your key health metrics (weight, active energy and steps).
Users can set targets for each of these metrics and can easily check their progress towards those targets throughout the day.
The HealthDash widget puts these metrics front and center and makes checking on progress even easier.
